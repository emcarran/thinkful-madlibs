# thinkful-madlibs
Practising Templating and Databinding for the Thinkful Frontend Angular course

For the MadLibs text please use the code bellow becuase there are no typos, all the variables have camelCase (instead of spaces) and extra Ps for formatting:

```
<p>{{femaleName}} was a {{jobTitle}} who loved technology. Although she loved parts of her job, she absolutely hated {{tediousTask}} and {{dirtyTask}}. So, {{femaleName}} met with her life mentor {{celebrity}} who told her to learn how to {{uselessSkill}} with Thinkful. Thinkful didn't offer a course on {{uselessSkill}} so she studied programming instead. </p>
<p>What a great decision! With her new skills, {{femaleName}} built a(n) {{adjective}} robot named {{obnoxiousCelebrity}} that not only loved {{dirtyTask}} but did it {{hugeNumber}} times faster. </p>
```
